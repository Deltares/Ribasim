# Bach

**Documentation: https://deltares.github.io/Bach.jl/**

Bach is a water resources model, designed to be the replacement of the regional surface
water modules Mozart and SIMRES in the Netherlands Hydrological Instrument (NHI). Bach is
a work in progress, it is a prototype that demonstrates all essential functionalities.
Further development of the prototype in a software release is planned in 2022 and 2023.

Bach is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built
on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/)
libraries, notably [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://mtk.sciml.ai/stable/).

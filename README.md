Ribasim is a water resources model, designed to be the replacement of the regional surface
water modules Mozart and SIMRES in the Netherlands Hydrological Instrument (NHI). Ribasim is
a work in progress, it is a prototype that demonstrates all essential functionalities.

Ribasim is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built
on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/)
libraries.

The kernel of Ribasim is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/) libraries, notably [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/).

The [Ribasim Python package](/install.qmd) is available to build, update and analyze Ribasim models programmatically.
For runtime data exchange and coupling with other kernels, the Julia kernel is wrapped in a Python API (`ribasim_api`) which implements the Basic Modelling Interface [BMI](https://bmi-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Ribasim uses [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) files to store the model database (`database.gpkg`).
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) works well with GeoPackage files.
This makes QGIS the perfect application to inspect and make edits to Ribasim models.
Deltares also provides the iMOD QGIS plugin, which can be used to inspect the results of a Ribasim model too.
For larger edits using Python is recommended.
One can also use Ribasim Python to build entire models from base data, such that your model setup is fully reproducible.

# Download {#sec-download}

- Ribasim executable - Windows: [ribasim_windows.zip](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/latest/download/ribasim_windows.zip)
- Ribasim executable - Linux: [ribasim_linux.zip](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/latest/download/ribasim_linux.zip)
- QGIS plugin: [ribasim_qgis.zip](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/latest/download/ribasim_qgis.zip).
- Generated testmodels: [generated_testmodels.zip](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/latest/download/generated_testmodels.zip)

The Ribasim Python package is [registered in PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ribasim/) and [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge/packages/ribasim) and can therefore be installed with [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) or [pixi](https://pixi.sh/):
```
pip install ribasim
```

# Ribasim core

Ribasim is typically used as a command-line interface (CLI). It is distributed as a `.zip`
archive, that must be downloaded and unpacked. It can be placed anywhere, however it is
important that the contents of the zip file are kept together in a directory. The Ribasim
executable is in the main folder.

To check whether the installation was performed successfully, open a terminal and go to the path where the executable is for example 'C:\Ribasim\ribasim_windows'.
If you are using cmd.exe type `ribasim`, or for PowerShell `./ribasim`.

This will give the following message:

```
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  <TOML_PATH>

Usage: ribasim <TOML_PATH>

For more information, try '--help'.'
```

# Ribasim Python

The Ribasim Python package (named `ribasim`) aims to make it easy to build, update and analyze Ribasim models
programmatically.

The Ribasim QGIS plugin allows users to construct a model from scratch without programming.
For specific tasks, like adding observed rainfall timeseries, it can be faster to use
Python instead.

One can also use Ribasim Python to build entire models from base data, such that your model
setup is fully reproducible.

The package is [registered in PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ribasim/) and can therefore
be installed with [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html):
```
pip install ribasim
```

For documentation please see the [examples](/guide/examples.ipynb) and [API reference](/reference/reference).

# Ribasim QGIS plugin

The Ribasim QGIS plugin requires [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) 3.34 or higher.

## Install Ribasim plugin

Download `ribasim_qgis.zip`, see the [download section](#sec-download).

Plugins menu > Manage and Install Plugins...

Select "Install from ZIP":

- Browse to the `ribasim_qgis.zip` file containing the plugin that was downloaded earlier
- Click "Install Plugin"

## Install iMOD plugin

In QGIS, navigate to "Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > All".
In the search bar, type: "iMOD". Select the iMOD plugin, and click "Install".

At least version 0.5.2 of the iMOD plugin is required.

The Time Series widget from the iMOD plugin is used for visualizing Ribasim results, which is described in the [results section](#sec-results).
Documentation on the Time Series widget can be found in the [iMOD documentation](https://deltares.github.io/iMOD-Documentation/qgis_user_manual.html#time-series-time-series).

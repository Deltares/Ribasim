In this document, we describe how to install the different components of Ribasim.
First the components and their relation are introduced, then installation instructions per component follow.

# Components {#sec-components}

The figure below illustrates the relation between the various components of Ribasim.

There are three main components of the Ribasim software package.
They are the Ribasim core (written in Julia language), the Ribasim Python package and the Ribasim QGIS plugin.

The kernel of Ribasim is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/) libraries, notably [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/).

The [Ribasim Python package](/reference/python/index.qmd) is available to build, update and analyze Ribasim models programmatically.
For runtime data exchange and coupling with other kernels, the Julia kernel is wrapped in a Python API (`ribasim_api`) which implements the Basic Model Interface [BMI](https://bmi-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Ribasim uses [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) files to store the model database (`database.gpkg`).
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) works well with GeoPackage files.
This makes QGIS the perfect application to inspect and make edits to Ribasim models.
Deltares also provides the iMOD QGIS plugin, which can be used to inspect the results of a Ribasim model too.
For larger edits using Python is recommended.
One can also use Ribasim Python to build entire models from base data, such that your model setup is fully reproducible.

# Install all components into a Pixi workspace (recommended) {#sec-install-all}

We recommend most users to install all components into one [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) workspace.
With it we can provide quick and reproducible steps to get started with modeling.
Note that if you only wish to visualize models, you can [just install the QGIS plugin](@sec-install-qgis-plugin).

First install Pixi following the [Pixi installation documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/).
Note that if the recommended installation methods don't work due to restriction on your PC, the [zipped executable](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/#download-from-github-releases) is likely to still work.

```sh
# Open your terminal in a new empty project folder.
# Create a new Pixi workspace.
pixi init

# Add Ribasim, QGIS and download & unpack tools.
# Remove qgis if you prefer to use an existing QGIS installation.
pixi add ribasim==2025.4.0 curl 7zip qgis

# Download latest Ribasim QGIS plugin.
pixi run curl -O https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/download/v2025.4.0/ribasim_qgis.zip

# Start QGIS and install the Ribasim and iMOD plugins manually.
# If you did not `pixi add qgis`, start QGIS yourself.
pixi run qgis

# After installation you can remove the plugin ZIP file
pixi run rm ribasim_qgis.zip

# Download latest Ribasim core for Windows, unpack and remove ZIP file.
# Takes some time due to download size.
# Replace `windows` with `linux` if you are using Linux.
pixi run curl -O https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/download/v2025.4.0/ribasim_windows.zip
pixi run 7z x ribasim_windows.zip
pixi run rm ribasim_windows.zip


# TODO works cross-platform, rm 7zip
tar -x
rm

# TODO see if we can add our CLI to the path
[target.win.activation.env]
PATH="$PATH;ribasim/ribasim"
```

The latest Ribasim release is currently `2025.4.0`.
If you wish to install one of the [older releases](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases), replace the version number in the script above.

Since a Pixi workspace is isolated from other installations such as Python on your system, you can install different versions of Ribasim in different places.

Note only that QGIS plugins are by default installed into the default user profile, which is shared.
You need to create separate user profiles if you wish to install and use different versions of the QGIS plugin at the same time.

If you wish to check what is installed in your workspace, run `pixi list`.
When you run into what seem like installation issues, try `pixi clean`, followed by `pixi install`.

If your editor does not automatically detect the right Python environment, point it to `.pixi/envs/default/python.exe`.
Starting your editor via Pixi will also help it find the environment since it will already be active.
For Visual Studio Code, you can run `pixi run code .` to open your workspace.

# Install Ribasim core {#sec-install-core}

Ribasim is typically used as a command-line interface (CLI). It is distributed as a `.zip`
archive, that must be downloaded and unpacked. It can be placed anywhere, however it is
important that the contents of the zip file are kept together in a directory. The Ribasim
executable is in the main folder.

To download the Ribasim core, download the appropriate zip file for your operating system:

- Ribasim executable - Windows: [ribasim_windows.zip](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/latest/download/ribasim_windows.zip)
- Ribasim executable - Linux: [ribasim_linux.zip](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/latest/download/ribasim_linux.zip)

Note that we currently only support and provide binaries for Windows and Linux, for the x86_64 architecture.

To check whether the installation was performed successfully, open a terminal and go to the path where the executable is for example `C:\bin\ribasim\`.
If you are using cmd.exe type `ribasim`, or for PowerShell `./ribasim`.

This will give the following message:

```
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  <TOML_PATH>

Usage: ribasim <TOML_PATH>

For more information, try '--help'.'
```

# Install Ribasim Python {#sec-install-python}

The Ribasim Python package (named `ribasim`) aims to make it easy to build, update and analyze Ribasim models
programmatically.

The Ribasim QGIS plugin allows users to construct a model from scratch without programming.
For specific tasks, like adding observed rainfall timeseries, it can be faster to use
Python instead.

One can also use Ribasim Python to build entire models from base data, such that your model
setup is fully reproducible.

The Ribasim Python package is [registered in PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ribasim/) and [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge/packages/ribasim) and can therefore be installed with [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) or [pixi](https://pixi.sh/):

```sh
pip install ribasim
```
or create a pixi environment in your modeling project with:
```sh
pixi init
```
and install ribasim:
```sh
pixi add ribasim
```
For documentation please see the [examples](/guide/examples.qmd) and [API reference](/reference/python/index.qmd).

# Install Ribasim QGIS plugin {#sec-install-qgis-plugin}

The Ribasim QGIS plugin requires [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) 3.34 or higher.
The Ribasim QGIS plugin is only distributed as a .zip archive and must be downloaded and installed in QGIS.

## Install Ribasim plugin

Firstly, download `ribasim_qgis.zip`:

- QGIS plugin: [ribasim_qgis.zip](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/releases/latest/download/ribasim_qgis.zip).

In QGIS, go to Plugins menu > Manage and Install Plugins...

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4471859/224939069-9aae77ea-898f-442f-83b5-f2671c114956.png){fig-align="left"}

Select "Install from ZIP":

- Browse to the `ribasim_qgis.zip` file containing the plugin that was downloaded earlier
- Click "Install Plugin"

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4471859/224939080-7fec5db2-4417-4f7b-8e45-034d4cf4fd75.png){fig-align="left"}

Open the Ribasim plugin panel.

## Install iMOD plugin

In QGIS, navigate to "Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > All".
In the search bar, type: "iMOD". Select the iMOD plugin, and click "Install".

At least version 0.5.2 of the iMOD plugin is required.

The Time Series widget from the iMOD plugin is used for visualizing Ribasim results, which is described in the [results section](#sec-results).
Documentation on the Time Series widget can be found in the [iMOD documentation](https://deltares.github.io/iMOD-Documentation/qgis_user_manual.html#time-series-time-series).

title: "Julia core"
---

With the term "core", we mean the computational engine of Ribasim. As detailed in the
[usage](usage.qmd) documentation, it is generally used as a command line tool.

The theory is described on the [equations](equations.qmd) page.

The core is implemented in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), and
can be found in the [Ribasim repository](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim) under the
`core/` folder. For developers we also advise to read the
[developer documentation](../developer/index.qmd).

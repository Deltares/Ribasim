    "# Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to Ribasim!\n",
    "This tutorial will help you get started with the basics of using Ribasim for river basin simulation.\n",
    "In this tutorial, the schematization of models is done in Python using the Ribasim Python package.\n",
    "The Ribasim Python package (named `ribasim`) simplifies the process of building, updating, and analyzing Ribasim model programmatically.\n",
    "It also allows for the creation of entire models from base data, ensuring that your model setup is fully reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this tutorial locally, install the latest release of Ribasim as documented in [the installation guide](/install.qmd).\n",
    "Some of the tutorials use a Python package that must be installed separately, [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on a fictional river basin called Crystal, which will serve as our case study.\n",
    "The guide is divided into different modules, each covering various scenarios.\n",
    "These include simulating natural flow, implementing reservoirs, and observing the impact of other structures.\n",
    "While not all node types and possibilities will be demonstrated, the focus will be on the most commonly used and significant situations.\n",
    "By the end of the tutorial, users will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Set up a basic Ribasim model**: Understand how to create a new model for a river basin using the Ribasim Python package.\n",
    "- **Evaluate the impact of demands**: Introduce water demand (such as irrigation) and assess their effects on the river basin.\n",
    "- **Modify and update models**: Learn how to update existing models with new data and changes.\n",
    "- **Analyze simulation results**: Use built-in tools to analyze and interpret the results of your simulations."

    "# Crystal River Basin\n",
    "We will examine a straightforward example of the Crystal river basin, which includes a main river and a single tributary flowing into the sea (see @fig-crystal-basin).\n",
    "Between 2014 and 2023 an average discharge of $44.45 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s}$ is measured at the confluence.\n",
    "In this module, the basin is free of any activities, allowing the model to simulate the natural flow.\n",
    "The next step is to include a demand (irrigation) that taps from a canal out of the main river.\n",

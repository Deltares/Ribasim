title: "QGIS plugin manual test plan"
---

This document describes how to perform a full manual test on the Ribasim QGIS plugin.
Known shortcomings and issues can be documented [here](/known_issues.qmd).
Bugs can be reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/issues).

# Clean slate tests
Before starting with data, perform the following tests to see if the plugin doesn't result in any errors.

## Enable and disable

- Open QGIS and navigate to "Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...": _The plugin management window opens_.
- Navigate to "Installed": _Ribasim plugin is in the list (enabled)_.
- Disable the Ribasim plugin: _Ribasim plugin panel hides if it was open, Ribasim button hides from navigation toolbar_.
- Enable the Ribasim plugin: _Ribasim button shows on the navigation toolbar_.

## Open and close

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel hides_.

# Model tab button interaction tests

## Open model twice

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the "Open" button in the Ribasim panel: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Choose an existing model from the `generated_testmodels` folder.
- Press OK: _The model layers appear in the layer panel and on the map_.
- Press the "Open" button: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Open the same model again: _A new layer group is added to the layers panel_.

Intended behavior: The same model is loaded twice, but there is only a connection on the last loaded model when interacting with the plugin.

# Map interaction tests

## Node selection on map triggers table selection

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the "Open" button in the Ribasim panel: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Choose an existing model from the `generated_testmodels` folder.
- Press OK: _The model layers appear in the layer panel and on the map_.
- Select the node layer, and make a subselection of nodes on the map: _Nodes are highlighted in yellow, including their links_.
- Open the Link attribute table: _The highlighted rows are those with a from/to node\_id that was selected_.
- Open any non-spatial attribute table: _The highlighted rows are those with a node\_id that was selected_.

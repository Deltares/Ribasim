title: "QGIS plugin manual test plan"
---

This document describes how to perform a full manual test on the Ribasim QGIS plugin.
Known shortcomings and issues can be documented [here](/known_issues.qmd).
Bugs can be reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/issues).

# Clean slate tests
Before starting with data, perform the following tests to see if the plugin doesn't result in any errors.

## Enable and disable

- Open QGIS and navigate to "Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins...": _The plugin management window opens_.
- Navigate to "Installed": _Ribasim plugin is in the list (enabled)_.
- Disable the Ribasim plugin: _Ribasim plugin panel hides if it was open, Ribasim button hides from navigation toolbar_.
- Enable the Ribasim plugin: _Ribasim button shows on the navigation toolbar_.

## Open and close

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel hides_.

## Button states on startup

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- _In the Nodes tab, all buttons are disabled_.

❌ [Failing](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/issues/1678)

# Model tab button interaction tests

## Open model twice

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the "New" button in the Model tab: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Fill in a name ("test1").
- Press OK: _A TOML and database file are created on the given location_.
- Press the "Open" button in the Model tab: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Open test1.toml: _A new layer group is added to the layers panel_.
- In the Nodes tab press "Basin / profile": _A Basin / profile table layer is added to the last layer group only_.

Intended behavior: The same model is loaded twice, but there is only a connection on the last loaded model when interacting with the plugin.

# Nodes tab button interaction tests

## Add all tables to new model

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the "New" button in the Model tab: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Fill in a name ("test1").
- Press OK: _A TOML and database file are created on the given location_.
- Go to the Nodes tab: _All buttons are enabled_.
- From left to right, top to bottom, press every button to add tables to the layers: _The layer group contains extra layers for every button clicked. Basin / area is a MultiPolygon layer_.
- Navigate to Model tab: _All layers are added to the panel_.
- Press the "Open" button to open the same model once again: _The layers panel adds the model containing all of its layers, the Model tab was refreshed_.

## Add table twice to new model

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the "New" button in the Model tab: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Fill in a name ("test1").
- Press OK: _A TOML and database file are created on the given location_.
- Go to the Nodes tab: _All buttons are enabled_.
- Press the Basin / time button: _A layer is added to the layers panel with that name, the button becomes disabled_.

# Map interaction tests

## Add points to Node layer

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the "New" button in the Model tab: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Fill in a name ("test1").
- Press OK: _A TOML and database file are created on the given location_.
- Select the Node layer in the Layers tab: _edit buttons in the toolbar become enabled_.
- Edit the layer by pressing the pencil button: _Add Point Feature button becomes enabled_.
- Click in the canvas: _Popup appears with Feature Attributes to fill in_.
- Press OK: _The first Node appears on the map_.
- Click in the canvas again: _Popup appears with Feature Attributes to fill in_.
- Press OK: _The second Node appears on the map_.

Unexpected behavior: The default type of the nodes is NULL, and therefore undefined.
Should be enforced and validated.
See [issue](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/issues/1688#issuecomment-2265315907).

## Add links to Link layer

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the "New" button in the Model tab: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Fill in a name ("test1").
- Press OK: _A TOML and database file are created on the given location_.
- Select the Node layer in the Layers tab: _edit buttons in the toolbar become enabled_.
- Edit the layer by pressing the pencil button: _Add Point Feature button becomes enabled_.
- Click in the canvas: _Popup appears with Feature Attributes to fill in_.
- Add a node id of 1, press OK: _The first Node appears on the map_.
- Click in the canvas again: _Popup appears with Feature Attributes to fill in_.
- Add a node id of 2, press OK: _The second Node appears on the map_.
- Select the Link layer in the Layers tab: _edit buttons in the toolbar become enabled_.
- Enable snapping under View > Toolbars > Snapping Toolbars: _Magnet button is enabled and active_.
- Press the Add Line Feature button: _Mouse becomes a crosshair_.
- Snap a line between the two nodes, click the two nodes and then right click to finish: _Popup shows with input, most fields are set to NULL_.
- Press OK: _Line appears on screen between the two nodes_.
- Save the layer's edits: _The line becomes blue_.
- Open the attribute table: _The information shows the from\_node\_id, to\_node\_id. This information matches the information from the Node table._

## Node selection on map triggers table selection

- Open QGIS and ensure that the Ribasim plugin is installed and enabled.
- Open the application via the Ribasim button on the QGIS toolbar: _Ribasim panel opens_.
- Press the "Open" button in the Model tab: _file navigation window pops up_.
- Choose an existing model from the `generated_testmodels` folder.
- Press OK: _The model layers appear in the layer panel and on the map_.
- Select the node layer, and make a subselection of nodes on the map: _Nodes are highlighted in yellow, including their links_.
- Open the Link attribute table: _The highlighted rows are those with a from/to node\_id that was selected_.
- Open any non-spatial attribute table: _The highlighted rows are those with an node\_id that was selected_.

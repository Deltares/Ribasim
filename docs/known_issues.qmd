Known issues can be found on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/issues).
Besides the issues that need to be fixed, there are also considerations that had to be made while developing the application.

# Core
- The non-default solver option `sparse = false` doesn't currently work.

# QGIS plugin

- Input tables that are in Arrow files are currently not automatically loaded in QGIS ([#318](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/issues/318)).
- Results in NetCDF format are currently not automatically loaded in QGIS ([#2519](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/issues/2519)).

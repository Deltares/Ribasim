Known issues can be found on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim/issues).
Besides the issues that need to be fixed, there are also considerations that had to be made while developing the application.

# QGIS Plugin Known Shortcomings

- The QGIS plugin does not have a dynamic relation between its own plugin and the layers that are loaded in the QGIS project.
  That means that deleting a layer from the layers panel does not automatically remove it from the GeoPackage, as the layers are clones.
- Tables and geometries are not linked. If you remove an link or a node, the tables containing information about those objects will remain.
  It is up to the user to clean up all tables.
- The QGIS plugin does not update links when nodes are moved.
  Snapping is only used to grab the information of the node the user points to.

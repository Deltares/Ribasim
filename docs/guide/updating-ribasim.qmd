title: "Updating Ribasim"
---

This guide explains how to update Ribasim models from older versions to newer versions.
To update the Ribasim installation itself, follow the [installation steps](/install.qmd), ensuring that all installed components are the same.
To see the most important changes in Ribasim, consult the [changelog](/changelog.qmd).

# Version numbers and breaking changes

Ribasim uses version numbers like `2023.1.0`, following `YYYY.MINOR.MICRO` from [calver](https://calver.org/).
It starts with the year the release was made, followed by the minor version number for normal releases, and a micro number for non-breaking, hotfix releases.
This means that whenever the year or minor version changes, there is a possibility that the user has to make changes to the model for it to keep working.
If this is the case, it will be highlighted in the [changelog](/changelog.qmd).
When possible, we automate this process using model migration in Ribasim Python, see the section below.

# Automatic model migration

The Ribasim Python package contains a set of migration functions that will be applied to the model on demand.
A simple example is adding a new column with optional values in a table.
For the core this change is currently breaking because it expects the column to exist,
hence the core will always expect models to be written by the same Ribasim Python version as itself.
It therefore gives a warning whenever the `ribasim_version` in the TOML does not match `ribasim --version`, as this may or may not work.

Ribasim Python will automatically add the new column for you when reading an older version, and update the model version accordingly.
So to migrate an existing model to the latest version you can use the following script:

```python
import ribasim

# Read the old model (migration happens automatically)
model = ribasim.Model.read("path/to/your/old_model.toml")

# Write the migrated model
model.write("path/to/your/migrated_model.toml")
```

If you have a script to build your model, re-running the script with a new Ribasim Python version will produce the update model version, and the above step won't be needed.

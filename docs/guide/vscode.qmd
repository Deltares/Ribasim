This guide explains how to set up [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) for working with Ribasim Python.
This page is not specific to Ribasim Python but aims to help users get started.
This guide assumes you have already installed Ribasim Python in a uv or Pixi environment as described in the [installation guide](install.qmd#sec-python).
See also the [VS Code docs for Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).

# Recommended extensions {#sec-extensions}

Install the following VS Code extensions for the best experience:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) - Essential Python language support
- [Python Environments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) - Enhanced environment management

The Python Environments extension provides out-of-the-box support for `venv` environments, which is the environment type that uv creates.

# Install packages for notebooks {#sec-notebooks}

VS Code requires `ipykernel` and `pip` to run Jupyter notebooks.
Add these packages based on your package manager:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## uv
```sh
uv add ipykernel pip
```

## pixi
```sh
pixi add ipykernel pip
```

:::

# Environment setup {#sec-environment}

::: {.panel-tabset}

## uv

uv creates a standard `.venv` virtual environment in your project folder.
This environment type is supported out of the box by VS Code with the Python Environments extension.

VS Code should automatically detect the `.venv` environment.
If not, select it manually:

1. Open your project folder in VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette ({{< kbd Ctrl-Shift-P >}} or {{< kbd Cmd-Shift-P >}} on macOS)
3. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
4. Select the Python executable from your `.venv` folder (`.venv/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows, `.venv/bin/python` on Linux/macOS)

## pixi

For Pixi environments, we recommend installing the [Pixi extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=renan-r-santos.pixi-code).
This helps the Python Environments extension detect Pixi environments.

VS Code should automatically detect the Pixi environment with these extensions installed.
If not, select it manually:

1. Open your project folder in VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette ({{< kbd Ctrl-Shift-P >}} or {{< kbd Cmd-Shift-P >}} on macOS)
3. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
4. Select the Python executable from your Pixi environment (`.pixi/envs/default/python.exe` on Windows, `.pixi/envs/default/bin/python` on Linux/macOS)

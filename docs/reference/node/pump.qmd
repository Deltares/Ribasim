title: "Pump"
---

Pump water from a source node to a destination node.
The set flow rate will be pumped unless the intake storage is less than $10~m^3$,
in which case the flow rate will be linearly reduced to $0~m^3/s$.
The intake must be either a Basin or LevelBoundary.
When PID controlled, the pump must point away from the controlled basin in terms of edges.

# Equations

The behavior of a Pump is simple if these nodes are not PID controlled.
Their flow is given by a fixed flow rate $q$, multiplied by reduction factors:

$$
Q = \mathrm{clamp}(\phi Q_\text{set}, Q_{\min}, Q_{\max})
$$

- $Q$ is the realized Pump flow rate.
- $Q_\text{set}$ is the Pump's target `flow_rate`.
- $Q_{\min}$ and $Q_{\max}$ are the Pump `min_flow_rate` and `max_flow_rate`.
- $\phi$ is the reduction factor, which smoothly reduces flow based on all of these criteria:
  - The upstream volume is below $10 m^3$.
  - The upstream level is below `min_upstream_level` + $0.02 m$
  - The downstream level is above `max_downstream_level` - $0.02 m$

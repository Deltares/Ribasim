title: "FlowBoundary"
---

A FlowBoundary adds water to the model at a specified flow rate.
It can be used as a boundary condition like a measured upstream flow rate, or lateral inflow.
We require that an link connected to a FlowBoundary is always outgoing, and points towards a Basin.

# Tables

## Static

column        | type    | unit                  | restriction
------------- | ------- | --------------------- | -----------
node_id       | Int32   | -                     |
active        | Bool    | -                     | (optional, default true)
flow_rate     | Float64 | $\text{m}^3/\text{s}$ | non-negative

## Time

This table is the transient form of the `FlowBoundary` table.
The only differences are that a time column is added and the nodes are assumed to be active so this column is not present.
With this the flow rates can be updated over time. In between the given times the
flow rate is interpolated linearly, and outside the flow rate is constant given by the
nearest time value.
Note that a `node_id` can be either in this table or in the static one, but not both.

column    | type     | unit                  | restriction
--------- | -------  | --------------------- | -----------
node_id   | Int32    | -                     |
time      | DateTime | -                     |
flow_rate | Float64  | $\text{m}^3/\text{s}$ | non-negative

## Concentration {#sec-flow-boundary-conc}
This table defines the concentration of substances for the flow from the FlowBoundary.

column         | type     | unit                  | restriction
-------------- | -------- | --------------------- | -----------
node_id        | Int32    | -                     |
time           | DateTime | -                     |
substance      | String   | -                     | can correspond to known Delwaq substances
concentration  | Float64  | $\text{g}/\text{m}^3$ |

# Equations

A FlowBoundary can be connected directly to a Basin and prescribes the flow to that Basin.
Since the `flow_rate` cannot be negative a FlowBoundary can only add water to the model.

title: "FlowDemand"
---

A `FlowDemand` node associates a non-consuming flow demand to a connector node (e.g. `Pump`, `TabulatedRatingCurve`) for one or more demand priorities.
FlowDemand nodes can set a flow demand only for a single connector node.
FlowDemand nodes do nothing when allocation is not activated, except when they are connected to a Pump or an Outlet. In that case the flow demand flow rate is taken as the minimum flow through that Pump or Outlet.

# Tables

## Static

column          | type     | unit                  | restriction
--------------- | -------- | --------------------- | -----------
node_id         | Int32    | -                     |
demand_priority | Int32    | -                     | positive
demand          | Float64  | $\text{m}^3/\text{s}$ | non-negative

## Time

This table is the transient form of the `FlowDemand` table, in which a time-dependent demand can be supplied.
Similar to the static version, only a single priority per `FlowDemand` node can be provided.

column          | type     | unit                  | restriction
--------------- | -------- | --------------------- | -----------
node_id         | Int32    | -                     |
time            | DateTime | -                     |
demand_priority | Int32    | -                     | positive
demand          | Float64  | $\text{m}^3/\text{s}$ | non-negative

title: "Junction"
---

A Junction is a node that does nothing, but can be used to simplify networks that would otherwise result in many overlapping edges.
It can act as a confluence and/or bifurcation.

Junctions can connect to other Junctions, but are not allowed to form cycles. Note that a confluence Junction followed by bifurcation Junction is generally invalid, as it will connect a connector node with multiple basins.


# Tables

No tables are required for Junction nodes.

# Equations

Junctions connect all upstream nodes with all downstream nodes,
and are not used in the equations themselves.

# Examples

This testmodel (juction_combined) with Junctions
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    C{Boundary} --> E[/Junction\]
    E --> F((Basin))
    E --> G((Basin))
    F --> H{Connector}
    G --> I{Connector}
    H --> J[/Junction\]
    I --> J
    J --> K((Basin))
```

translates to the following model:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    C{Boundary} --> F((Basin))
    C --> G((Basin))
    F --> H{Connector}
    G --> I{Connector}
    H --> K((Basin))
    I --> K
```

And this testmodel (junction_chained) with Junctions

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A{Connector} --> D[/Junction\]
    B{Connector} --> D[/Junction\]
    C{Connector} --> E[/Junction\]
    D --> E
    E --> F((Basin))
```

translates to the following model:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A{Connector} --> F((Basin))
    B{Connector} --> F
    C{Connector} --> F
```

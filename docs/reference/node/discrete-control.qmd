Set parameters of other nodes based on model state conditions (e.g. Basin level).
The table below shows which parameters are controllable for a given node type.

```{julia}
# | code-fold: true
using Ribasim
using DataFrames: DataFrame
using MarkdownTables

node_names = Symbol[]
controllable_parameters = String[]

for node_type in fieldtypes(Ribasim.Parameters)
    if node_type <: Ribasim.AbstractParameterNode
        node_name = nameof(node_type)
        controllable_fields = Ribasim.controllablefields(node_name)
        controllable_fields = sort!(string.(controllable_fields))
        if node_name == :TabulatedRatingCurve
            controllable_fields = map(s -> replace(s, "table" => "q(h) relationship (given by level, flow_rate)"), controllable_fields)
        end
        if !isempty(controllable_fields)
            push!(node_names, Ribasim.snake_case(node_name))
            push!(controllable_parameters, join(controllable_fields, ", "))
        end
    end
end

df = DataFrame(:node => node_names, :controllable_parameters => controllable_parameters)

# Tables

## Variable

The compound variable schema defines linear combinations of variables which can be used in conditions. This means that
this schema defines new variables with the given `compound_variable_id` that look like
$$
\text{weight}_1 * \text{variable}_1 + \text{weight}_2 * \text{variable}_2 + \ldots,
$$

which can be for instance an average or a difference of variables. If a variable comes from a time-series, a look ahead $\Delta t$ can be supplied.

column               | type     | unit    | restriction
-------------------- | -------- | ------- | -----------
node_id              | Int32    | -       | sorted
compound_variable_id | Int32    | -       | sorted per node_id
listen_node_type     | String   | -       | known node type
listen_node_id       | Int32    | -       | sorted per node_id
variable             | String   | -       | must be "level" or "flow_rate", sorted per listen_node_id
weight               | Float64  | -       | (optional, default 1.0)
look_ahead           | Float64  | $s$     | Only on transient boundary conditions, non-negative (optional, default 0.0).

## Condition

The condition schema defines conditions of the form 'the `discrete_control` node with this `node_id` listens to whether the variable given by the `node_id` and `compound_variable_id` is greater than `greater_than`'.
Multiple conditions with different `greater_than` values can be defined on the same compound_variable.

column               | type     | unit    | restriction
-------------------- | -------- | ------- | -----------
node_id              | Int32    | -       | sorted
compound_variable_id | Int32    | -       | -
greater_than         | Float64  | various | sorted per variable

## Logic

The logic schema defines which control states are triggered based on the truth of the conditions a DiscreteControl node listens to.
DiscreteControl is applied in the Julia core as follows:

- During the simulation it is checked whether the truth of any of the conditions changes.
- When a condition changes, the corresponding DiscreteControl node ID is retrieved (node_id in the condition schema above).
- The truth value of all the conditions this DiscreteControl node listens to are retrieved, **in the sorted order as specified in the condition schema**. This is then converted into a string of "T" for true and "F" for false. This string we call the truth state.*
- The table below determines for the given DiscreteControl node ID and truth state what the corresponding control state is.
- For all the nodes this DiscreteControl node affects (as given by the "control" edges in [Edges / static](/reference/usage.qmd#edge)), their parameters are set to those parameters in `NodeType / static` corresponding to the determined control state.

*.  There is also a second truth state created in which for the last condition that changed it is specified whether it was an upcrossing ("U") or downcrossing ("D") of the threshold (greater than) value. If a control state is specified for a truth state that is crossing-specific, this takes precedence over the control state for the truth state that contains only "T" and "F".

:::{.callout-note}
When creating truth states, it is important to not use the order of the condition table as you provide it, but the order as it is written to the file.
Users can provide tables in any order, but when writing the model it gets sorted in the required order as specified in the schema.

node_id        | Int32    | -    | sorted
control_state  | String   | -    | -
truth_state    | String   | -    | Consists of the characters "T" (true), "F" (false), "U" (upcrossing), "D" (downcrossing) and "*" (any), sorted per node_id

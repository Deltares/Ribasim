Set parameters of other nodes based on model state conditions (e.g. Basin level).
The table below shows which parameters are controllable for a given node type.

```{julia}
# | code-fold: true
using Ribasim
using DataFrames: DataFrame
using MarkdownTables

node_names = Symbol[]
controllable_parameters = String[]

for node_type in fieldtypes(Ribasim.Parameters)
    if node_type <: Ribasim.AbstractParameterNode
        node_name = nameof(node_type)
        controllable_fields = Ribasim.controllablefields(node_name)
        controllable_fields = sort!(string.(controllable_fields))
        if node_name == :TabulatedRatingCurve
            controllable_fields = map(
                s -> replace(s, "table" => "q(h) relationship (given by level, flow_rate)"),
                controllable_fields,
            )
        end
        if !isempty(controllable_fields)
            push!(node_names, Ribasim.snake_case(node_name))
            push!(controllable_parameters, join(controllable_fields, ", "))
        end
    end
end

df = DataFrame(:node => node_names, :controllable_parameters => controllable_parameters)

# Tables

## Variable

The compound variable schema defines linear combinations of variables which can be used in conditions. This means that
this schema defines new variables with the given `compound_variable_id` that look like
$$
\text{weight}_1 * \text{variable}_1 + \text{weight}_2 * \text{variable}_2 + \ldots,
$$

which can be for instance an average or a difference of variables. If a variable comes from a time-series, a look ahead $\Delta t$ can be supplied.

column               | type     | unit       | restriction
-------------------- | -------- | -----------| -----------
node_id              | Int32    | -          |
compound_variable_id | Int32    | -          |
listen_node_id       | Int32    | -          |
variable             | String   | -          | must be "level" or "flow_rate"
weight               | Float64  | -          | (optional, default 1.0)
look_ahead           | Float64  | $\text{s}$ | Only on transient boundary conditions, non-negative (optional, default 0.0).

These variables can be listened to:
- The level of a Basin
- The level of a LevelBoundary (supports look ahead)
- The flow rate through one of these node types: Pump, Outlet, TabulatedRatingCurve, LinearResistance, ManningResistance
- The flow rate of a FlowBoundary (supports look ahead)

## Condition

The condition schema defines conditions of the form 'the `discrete_control` node with this `node_id` listens to whether the variable given by the `node_id` and `compound_variable_id` is greater than `greater_than`' (at time $t$). In equation form:

$$
    \text{weight}_1 * \text{variable}_1 + \text{weight}_2 * \text{variable}_2 + \ldots > \text{greater\_than}(t).
$$

Multiple conditions with different `greater_than` values can be defined on the same compound_variable, each with their own unique `condition_id`.

Note the strict inequality '$>$' in the equation above. This means for instance that if a simulation starts with a compound variable exactly at the `greater_than` value, the condition is false.

column               | type     | unit    | restriction
-------------------- | -------- | ------- | -----------
node_id              | Int32    | -       | -
compound_variable_id | Int32    | -       | -
condition_id         | Int32    | -       | -
greater_than         | Float64  | various | -
time                 | DateTime | -       | (optional)

When no (or only a single) `time` is supplied for a given `condition_id`, the `greater_than` value of this condition is unchanging over time.

## Logic

The logic schema defines which control states are triggered based on the truth of the conditions a DiscreteControl node listens to.
DiscreteControl is applied in the Julia core as follows:

- During the simulation it is checked whether the truth of any of the conditions changes.
- When a condition changes, the corresponding DiscreteControl node ID is retrieved (node_id in the condition schema above).
- The truth value of all the conditions this DiscreteControl node listens to are retrieved, in the order of the condition IDs. This is then converted into a string of "T" for true and "F" for false. This string we call the truth state.
- The table below determines for the given DiscreteControl node ID and truth state what the corresponding control state is.
- For all the nodes this DiscreteControl node affects (as given by the "control" links in [Links / static](/reference/usage.qmd#link)), their parameters are set to those parameters in `NodeType / static` corresponding to the determined control state.

column         | type     | unit | restriction
-------------- | -------- | ---- | -----------
node_id        | Int32    | -    |
control_state  | String   | -    | -
truth_state    | String   | -    | Consists of the characters "T" (true), "F" (false) and "*" (any)

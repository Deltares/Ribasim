test 
A TabulatedRatingCurve determines outflow from a Basin by looking up the flow rate that corresponds to the current upstream level from a rating curve.
The TabulatedRatingCurve takes a rating curve as input.
Use it for instance to model flow over a weir.

# Tables

## Static

column               | type    | unit                  | restriction
-------------        | ------- | --------------------- | -----------
node_id              | Int32   | -                     |
control_state        | String  | -                     | (optional)
active               | Bool    | -                     | (optional, default true)
max_downstream_level | Float64 | $\text{m}$            | (optional)
level                | Float64 | $\text{m}$            | unique
flow_rate            | Float64 | $\text{m}^3/\text{s}$ | start at 0, increasing

Thus a single rating curve can be given by the following table:

node_id | flow_rate  | level
------- |----------- |-------
      2 | 0.0        | -0.10
      2 | 0.0001     |  0.09
      2 | 0.01       |  0.29
      2 | 0.9        | 20.09

Below the lowest given level of -0.10, the flow rate is kept at 0.
Between given levels the flow rate is interpolated linearly.
Above the maximum given level of 20.09, the flow rate keeps increases linearly according to the slope of the last segment.

For tabulated rating curves with a fixed maximum value (e.g. max capacity of a weir), enter a new row and re-enter the maximum flow_rate at an incrementally higher level:

node_id | flow_rate  | level
------- |----------- |-------
      2 | 0.0        | -0.10
      2 | 0.0001     |  0.09
      2 | 0.01       |  0.29
      2 | 0.9        | 20.09
      2 | 0.9        | 20.10

Here, the trc has a maximum flow_rate of 0.9 for for all levels 20.09 or higher.

Please note that Ribasim does not allow the flow rate to decrease at higher levels. To do so, a DiscreteControl node is needed to manipulate the flow_rate. This could be done to simulate the (partial) closing of a weir when the water level exceeds a certain threshold.


### Interpolation

The $Q(h)$ relationship of a tabulated rating curve is defined as a linear interpolation.

```{python}
# | code-fold: true
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

np.random.seed(0)
fontsize = 15

N = 10
level = np.cumsum(np.random.rand(N))
flow = level**2 + np.random.rand(N)
flow[0] = 0.0
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_xticks([])
ax.set_yticks([0])
ax.scatter(level, flow, label = "data")
ax.plot(level, flow, label = "interpolation", color = "C0")
ax.plot([level[0] - 1, level[0]], [0, 0], label = "extrapolation", linestyle = "dashed")
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlabel("level", fontsize = fontsize)
ax.set_ylabel("flow", fontsize = fontsize)

level_extrap = 2 * level[-1] - level[-2]
flow_extrap = 2 * flow[-1] - flow[-2]
ax.plot([level[-1], level_extrap], [flow[-1], flow_extrap], color = "C0", linestyle = "dashed")
ax.set_xlim(level[0] - 0.5, (level[-1] + level_extrap)/2)

markdown_table = pd.DataFrame(
        data = {
            "level" : level,
            "flow" : flow
        }
    ).to_markdown(index = False)

display(Markdown(markdown_table))
```

Here it is validated that the flow starts at $0$ and is non-decreasing. The flow is extrapolated as $0$ backward and linearly forward.

## Time

This table is the transient form of the `TabulatedRatingCurve` table.
The only difference is that a time column is added.
With this the rating curves can be updated over time.
The `max_downstream_level` currently cannot be updated over time.
Note that a `node_id` can be either in this table or in the static one, but not both.

column               | type     | unit                  | restriction
-------------------- | -------  | --------------------- | -----------
node_id              | Int32    | -                     |
time                 | DateTime | -                     |
level                | Float64  | $\text{m}$            |
flow_rate            | Float64  | $\text{m}^3/\text{s}$ | non-negative
max_downstream_level | Float64  | $\text{m}$            | (optional)

# Equations

The TabulatedRatingCurve is a tabulation of a Basin's discharge behavior.
It describes a piecewise linear relationship between the Basin's level and its discharge.
It can be understood as an empirical description of a Basin's properties.
This can include a weir, but also the lumped hydraulic behavior of the upstream channels.

$$
Q = \phi f(h)
$$

Where:

- $h$ is the upstream water level
- $f$ is a piecewise linear function describing the given rating curve $Q(h)$
- $\phi$ is the reduction factor, which smoothly reduces flow based on all of these criteria:
  - The upstream volume is below $10 m^3$.
  - The upstream level is less than $0.02 m$ above the downstream level.
  - The downstream level is above `max_downstream_level` - $0.02 m$

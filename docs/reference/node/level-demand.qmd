title: "LevelDemand"
---

A `LevelDemand` node associates a minimum and a maximum level with connected Basins to be used by the allocation algorithm.

Since this connection conveys information rather than flow, an outgoing control edge must be used.
Below the minimum level the Basin has a demand, above the maximum level the Basin has a surplus and acts as a source.
The source can be used by all nodes with demands in order of priority.

The same `LevelDemand` node can be used for Basins in different subnetworks.

Both `min_level` and `max_level` are optional, to be able to handle only the demand or surplus side.
If both are missing, `LevelDemand` won't have any effects on allocation.

# Tables

## Static

column        | type    | unit         | restriction
------------- | ------- | ------------ | -----------
node_id       | Int32   | -            | sorted
min_level     | Float64 | $\text{m}$   | (optional, default -Inf)
max_level     | Float64 | $\text{m}$   | (optional, default Inf)
priority      | Int32   | -            | positive

## Time

This table is the transient form of the `LevelDemand` table, in which time-dependent minimum and maximum levels can be supplied.
Similar to the static version, only a single priority per `LevelDemand` node can be provided.

column        | type     | unit         | restriction
------------- | -------  | ------------ | -----------
node_id       | Int32    | -            | sorted
time          | DateTime | -            | sorted per node id
min_level     | Float64  | $\text{m}$   | -
max_level     | Float64  | $\text{m}$   | -
priority      | Int32    | -            | positive

# Equations

A LinearResistance connects two Basins together.
The flow between the two Basins is determined by a linear relationship, up to an optional maximum flow rate:

$$
Q_\text{linear\_resistance} = \mathrm{clamp}\left(\frac{h_a - h_b}{R}, -Q_{\max}, Q_{\max}\right)
$$

Here $h_a$ is the water level in the incoming Basin and $h_b$ is the water level in the outgoing Basin.
$R$ is the resistance of the link, and $Q_{\max}$ is the maximum flow rate.
Water flows from high to low; either direction is possible.
